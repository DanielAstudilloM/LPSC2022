						<h2>Assesing Accuracy of Modelling Software with Lunar and Martian Basaltic Compositions</h2>
						<p>
							There haven't been studies dedicated to assess if the software used for modelling 
							equilibrium of phases in lunar basalts. It has been done previously for Earth
							 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egh043">Asimow and Longhi, 2004</a>)
							 and for Mars (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2013JE004461">Balta and McSween, 2013</a>).
							 We decided to explore this by modelling the compositions of known primary basalts and seeing where their Multiple 
							 Saturation Points (MSPs) were predicted in relation to their experiments. Initially we began doing this through 
							 MAGPOX and pMELTS, but recently added Perple_X with excellent results.
						</p>
						<div class="features">

								<h3>MSPs</h3>
								<p>We focus on MSPs at the liquidus of basalts and picritic glasses because they are one of the most useful tools for 
									exploring the distribution of cumulate sources
									in the lunar mantle. They accurately reflect the depths at which primary basalts form at, and the phases that melt 
									to do so. They also are a single point in phase diagrams that allows to check how accurately the olivine and pyroxene
									stability fields are modelled.
								</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h3>Lunar Samples</h3>
								<p>A set of 21 compositions of mare basalts, picritic glasses and meteorites were selected given their primary or 
									near-primary compositions, with well known experiments that show MSPs. The range of samples also cover much of 
									the Ti and Mg ranges for lunar basalts, as well as a range of a billion years of lunar products.
								</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h3>Martian Samples</h3>
								<p>We took 4 of the samples already studied by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2013JE004461">Balta and McSween, 2013</a>, 
									which also correspond to near-primary basalts for 2 main reasons: To corroborate our results with previous ones; 
									and because comparing the martian subset with a larger dataset was probably going to give better results, 
									which it did.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h3>Modifying or Adapting to the Software</h3>
								<p>
									We are working with 3 different software, written in Fortran and C a long time ago, designed for use through 
									single threaded calculations for a single set of compositions and conditions at a time. All software operates 
									through their own interface using the command console or a GUI. We modified and adapted to each program in order 
									to work through our own interface in which we could automate calculations as well as the data processing.
								</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h3>Python</h3>
								<p>Having previous experience and knowing the benefits of working in Python made it an easy choice for the language
									to work with. We started with simple scripts for bypassing input and automation of multiple compositions, which 
									eventually resulted in complex multifunctional libraries which also contain file management, data processing and 
									additional tools for working with the resulting data.
								</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h3>It Doesn't End Here</h3>
								<p>
									These software have proven many times over their usefulness in petrology and geochemistry, and we are convinced that 
									thay are only just starting to prove how far they can take us. By removing some of the barriers that difficulted 
									the use of these programs it is now easier than ever to explore your petrologic ideas through modelling. We have already 
									started doing so with our good friend Kim Cone, by currently working on an automatic Lunar Magma Ocean crystallization 
									modeler using Perple_X.

									<h2>pMELTS</h2>
									<p> Developed 20 years ago from the original MELTS program by Mark Ghiorso and collaborators, it is probably the most 
										popular tool for modelling fractional and equilibrium crystallization of mantle and crustal compositions, 
										given that it has an approachable interface through which to work from. However, running several 
										compositions over multiple conditions proves to be a very repetitive and monotonous experience, 
										as all of the input has to be done manually each time. A way to automate this process was needed 
										for our project, or otherwise it would have taken several months just to calculate everything we did.

									<h2>MAGPOX</h2>
									<p>A niche program developed by John Longhi almost 30 years ago to model equilibrium of mantle 
										and lunar basalts. It is a quick and effective way to approximate crystallization that has been 
										mostly used by our lunar community in combination with the sibling programs MAGFOX and FXMOTR for 
										fractional crystallization and a mixed approach focused on crystallization of the lunar magma ocean, 
										respectively. These are old Fortran codes designed for sigular calculations under one temperature-pressure 
										path, which we modified for automation and data management.

									<h2>Perple_X</h2>
									<p>A metamorfic petrologist favorite with a very active community, and in active development for over 30 years by 
										James Connolly. It is designed for the construccion of phase diagrams for many different types of rocks, as 
										it allows to do calculations from various thermodynamic approaches. It is a very thorough software that 
										performs several complex numerical calculations each time, which is why it can take several hours to process 
										a single composition. We had 25! At a minimum of 2 hours per calculation it would take over 2 days to process 
										all of them. Any error or undesirable result would mean over 2 days of work lost... and that just wasn't acceptable.
